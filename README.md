# first_cpp_project

My very first C++ project after tutorial. 

I have recently finished a youtube tutorial on basic C++. I was previously studying data structures for the minimax project and came to realise that most of the data structures are implemented in C++ or Java. Having learnt a little bit of C in the Harvard CS50 course, I reckon that C++ would be easier.

The reason behind learning C++ is because I wanted to practice on recreating the data structures learnt, which I could not do in Python as most of the theories are already implemented. After learning the syntax of C++, I jumped right in into my first project. 

This is a simple tictactoe which is a direct copy from my first Python project. The purpose of this project is to familiarise myself with the syntax of C++ and how variables and functions work. Please excuse my repetitive lines of codes. :)
